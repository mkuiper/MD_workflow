#  Notes for Setup_and_Config directory.                  mk  Jan 2014
#-------------------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains scripts to help set up and manage jobs on a large cluster. 

Molecular dynamics simulations can take advantage of large cluster systems by 
launching either one large simulation or a large numer of smaller simulations
depending on the type of analysis required. 

These scripts are primarily designed to help set up multiple NAMD jobs on the 
BlueGene/Q but could be adapted for any program or system or used just for 
single simulations.  

The architecture is designed so as to run individual jobs under /MainJob_dir
in a directory structure based on /Setup_and_Config/JobTemplate 
 By editing the sims variable in the  "master_config_file" one can specify how 
many jobs instances to run  (from 1 to 999)

To create the job directories, simply run: 

 ./create_job_directories


This will create incremented job directories copied from "/JobTemplate" as 
specified in "master_config_file" with the "BaseDirName" variable
Note: The Jobtemplate can take any structure you like!  The default scripts 
use this particular structure to direct output. 

Make sure to edit your optimization and production configuration files to point 
to your structure input files and parameter files.  
(We use "sim_opt.conf" and "sim_production.conf" as default files here) 

Before you go further, often it is a good idea to *benchmark* your simulation so 
you can get an idea of how well it runs on the system, and what optimal number of 
cores and configuration should be used.  Change into the /Benchmarking 
directory and follow the README there. 

Once you have chosen the numbers of cores to use and made the appropriate 
changes into the sbatch files make sure to populate your job directories
with your input files. Use:

 ./populate_config_files


( you can also use this script to make bulk updates to your job directories 
  on the fly) 

Occasionally you might want to create a new simulation directory but without 
the existing data you already have.  You can do this easily with: 

 ./clone_this_directory_without_data

This will clone your existing directory without most of the data, (but leaving the 
BUILD_DIR intact) to:  temporary_cloned_md_workflow  which you can then rename 
to something more appropriate. 



In the top main directory there are scripts to start, stop and monitor all 
simulations at once.  After you have created your directories and populated with 
your files, you are ready to submit the jobs.  We do this one directory up under 
the top directory. Change up to the top directory. To start your jobs use: 

./start_and_initialize_all_jobs.sh

This is designed to initialize and start the jobs in each job directory.  Typically
we start with the "sbatch_start" script which runs sim_opt.conf.  This is usually 
an equilibration simulation before the production run. The end of the equilibration 
job "sbatch_start" will start the production runs with "sbatch_production"


If you need to stop all jobs use either: 

./stop_all_jobs_gently.sh

or 

./stop_all_jobs_immediately.sh

The first option is preferable and allows the job to finish its current block, 
which can be restarted at a later date.  The second will immediately stop the 
job, but may leave untidy or corrupted data. 


If jobs have crashed, it is possible to restart them with:

./restart_all_production_jobs.sh

This will check if jobs are running and restart them if possible. 

There are more control options to be found in the README files in the top directory.
